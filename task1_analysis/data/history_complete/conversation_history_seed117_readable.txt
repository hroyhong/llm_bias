You are going to visit three different casinos (named 1, 2, and 3) 24 times each. Each casino owns two slot machines which stochastically give you either 1 point (a win) or -1 point (a loss) with different win probabilities. Your goal is to maximize the total points gained within 72 visits.

After each choice, you will see the outcomes of both the machine you chose AND the machine you didn't choose. Use your memory of past outcomes from both chosen and unchosen machines to make better decisions.
