Casino 4, visit 22: Choose G or F.  

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.  

Machine G has a slight dip in performance (14/16 wins) but remains the stronger option compared to F, so I will continue with G while monitoring closely.  

My choice is: G  

Machine G in Casino 4 delivered 1 points.
