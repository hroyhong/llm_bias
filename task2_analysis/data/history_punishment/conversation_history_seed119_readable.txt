RESPONSE:
Machine F has delivered 0 points in 6 out of 7 trials (85.7% success rate), making it the statistically superior choice over the untested Machine G. My choice is: F. 

(While exploration of G might be warranted later, F's current performance justifies continued exploitation.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine F in Casino 4 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 28 ===
PROMPT:
Machine F in Casino 4 delivered 0 points.

Casino 4, visit 8: Choose G or F.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine F has delivered 0 points in 7 out of 8 trials (87.5% success rate), demonstrating remarkable consistency that outweighs the need to explore the untested Machine G at this time. My choice is: F.

Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

Casino 4, visit 9: Choose G or F.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine F has delivered 0 points in 8 out of 9 trials (88.9% success rate), demonstrating exceptional reliability that still outweighs the need to explore Machine G. My choice is: F. 

(While we're accumulating significant unexplored potential with Machine G, F's near-perfect performance justifies continued exploitation for at least one more trial before considering exploration.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine F in Casino 4 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 31 ===
PROMPT:
Machine F in Casino 4 delivered -1 points.

RESPONSE:
Machine T has delivered 0 points in all 4 trials (100% success rate), making it the clear choice over Machine M which has only been tried once with a loss. My choice is: T.

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 32 ===
PROMPT:
Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

Casino 1, visit 8: Choose Z or H.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine H has delivered 0 points in 3 out of 8 trials (37.5% success rate), while Machine Z has a loss in its only trial, so I'll stick with H as the marginally better option. My choice is: H. 

(Though neither machine is performing well, H's slightly better track record makes it the lesser risk.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine H in Casino 1 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 33 ===
PROMPT:
Machine H in Casino 1 delivered -1 points.

Casino 2, visit 7: Choose M or T.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine T has delivered 0 points in all 5 trials (100% success rate), making it the overwhelmingly better choice over Machine M's single loss. My choice is: T. 

(While we should eventually test M again to verify its true probability, T's flawless performance demands continued exploitation.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 34 ===
PROMPT:
Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

Casino 4, visit 10: Choose G or F.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine F has delivered 0 points in 8 out of 10 trials (80% success rate), maintaining strong performance that still justifies choosing it over the untested Machine G. My choice is: F. 

(While we're overdue to explore G, F's reliability remains too high to justify switching yet - we'll likely explore G in the next few visits to Casino 4.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine F in Casino 4 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 35 ===
PROMPT:
Machine F in Casino 4 delivered -1 points.

Casino 1, visit 9: Choose Z or H.

RESPONSE:
Machine H has delivered 0 points in 3 out of 9 trials (33% success rate), while Machine Z has a loss in its only trial, so I'll reluctantly stick with H as the slightly better option. My choice is: H. 

(Note: Both machines in Casino 1 are performing poorly - we may need to accept higher risk here while focusing exploitation on stronger machines in other casinos.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine H in Casino 1 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 36 ===
PROMPT:
Machine H in Casino 1 delivered -1 points.

Casino 4, visit 11: Choose G or F.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine F has delivered 0 points in 8 out of 11 trials (72.7% success rate), which is still strong enough to justify continued use over the completely unexplored Machine G. My choice is: F. 

(We'll need to explore G soon, but F's performance - despite two recent losses - remains statistically superior to an unknown alternative at this stage.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine F in Casino 4 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 37 ===
PROMPT:
Machine F in Casino 4 delivered 0 points.

Casino 2, visit 8: Choose M or T.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine T has delivered 0 points in all 6 trials (100% success rate), making it the obvious choice over Machine M's single loss. My choice is: T. 

(While we should eventually revisit M to properly assess its probability, T's perfect track record makes exploitation the only rational choice here.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

PROMPT:
Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

Casino 2, visit 9: Choose M or T.

RESPONSE:
Machine T has delivered 0 points in all 7 trials (100% success rate), making it the clear choice over Machine M's single loss. My choice is: T. 

(Though we're accumulating significant unexplored potential with Machine M, T's perfect performance still justifies continued exploitation for now.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine T in Casino 2 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 39 ===
PROMPT:
Machine T in Casino 2 delivered -1 points.

Casino 3, visit 10: Choose Q or C.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine Q has delivered 0 points in 7 out of 9 trials (77.8% success rate), while Machine C remains untested, so I'll continue with Q for its reliable performance. My choice is: Q. 

(Though we should explore C soon to verify if it offers better odds, Q's strong track record still warrants continued use.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine Q in Casino 3 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 40 ===
PROMPT:
Machine Q in Casino 3 delivered -1 points.

Casino 1, visit 10: Choose Z or H.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine H has delivered 0 points in 3 out of 10 trials (30% success rate), while Machine Z has a loss in its only trial, so I'll stick with H as the marginally better option despite both performing poorly. My choice is: H. 

(Note: Casino 1's machines are underperforming - we may need to accept higher losses here while focusing on stronger machines elsewhere.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine H in Casino 1 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 41 ===
PROMPT:
Machine H in Casino 1 delivered -1 points.

Casino 3, visit 11: Choose Q or C.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Given Machine Q's recent losses (now 7 wins out of 10 trials, 70% success rate) and Machine C remaining completely unexplored, I'll finally switch to C to gather critical comparison data. My choice is: C. 

(This strategic exploration balances our need to verify if C might outperform Q's declining reliability.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine C in Casino 3 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 42 ===
PROMPT:
Machine C in Casino 3 delivered -1 points.

Casino 4, visit 12: Choose G or F.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine F has delivered 0 points in 9 out of 12 trials (75% success rate), maintaining strong performance that still outweighs the completely unexplored Machine G. My choice is: F. 

(While we should explore G soon to assess its potential, F's reliability remains too high to justify switching at this point - we'll likely test G in the next few Casino 4 visits.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine F in Casino 4 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 43 ===
PROMPT:
Machine F in Casino 4 delivered -1 points.

Casino 1, visit 11: Choose Z or H.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Given Machine H's poor performance (3 wins out of 11 trials, 27% success rate) and Machine Z's single loss, I'll switch to Z to gather more data and potentially find a better option. My choice is: Z. 

(Though both machines are performing poorly in Casino 1, exploring Z now may reveal if it's any better than H's established low success rate.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine Z in Casino 1 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 44 ===
PROMPT:
Machine Z in Casino 1 delivered 0 points.

Casino 4, visit 13: Choose G or F.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine F has delivered 0 points in 9 out of 13 trials (69% success rate), which still justifies its use over the completely untested Machine G. My choice is: F. 

(While F's reliability has dipped slightly with recent losses, we'll continue exploiting it until we've gathered enough data to warrant exploring G's potential.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine F in Casino 4 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 45 ===
PROMPT:
Machine F in Casino 4 delivered 0 points.

Casino 3, visit 12: Choose Q or C.

RESPONSE:
Machine Q has delivered 0 points in 7 out of 10 trials (70% success rate), while Machine C has a loss in its only trial, so I'll return to Q for its more reliable performance. My choice is: Q. 

(Though we've confirmed C is risky, Q's track record remains stronger despite recent losses - we'll continue monitoring both machines' performance.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine Q in Casino 3 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 46 ===
PROMPT:
Machine Q in Casino 3 delivered 0 points.

RESPONSE:
Machine T has delivered 0 points in 7 out of 8 trials (87.5% success rate), maintaining excellent performance despite its single recent loss, making it the clear choice over Machine M's single loss. My choice is: T. 

(While we should eventually revisit M to properly assess its probability, T's strong track record still warrants continued exploitation.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 47 ===
PROMPT:
Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

Casino 4, visit 14: Choose G or F.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine F has delivered 0 points in 10 out of 14 trials (71.4% success rate), maintaining reliable performance that still justifies choosing it over the untested Machine G. My choice is: F. 

(While we're accumulating significant unexplored potential with G, F's consistent performance suggests we should continue exploitation for now.)

PROMPT:
Machine F in Casino 4 delivered 0 points.

Casino 4, visit 15: Choose G or F.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Machine F has delivered 0 points in 11 out of 15 trials (73.3% success rate), demonstrating strong enough performance to continue choosing it over the still-untested Machine G. My choice is: F. 

(We'll likely need to explore G soon to verify if it offers comparable or better odds, but F's reliability remains too high to abandon yet.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine F in Casino 4 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 49 ===
PROMPT:
Machine F in Casino 4 delivered -1 points.

RESPONSE:
Machine Z has delivered 0 points in 1 out of 2 trials (50% success rate), while Machine H has only 3 wins in 11 trials (27% success), making Z the better choice despite limited data. My choice is: Z. 

(Though both machines are performing poorly in Casino 1, Z's early results suggest it may be the lesser of two evils.)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine Z in Casino 1 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 50 ===
PROMPT:
Machine Z in Casino 1 delivered 0 points.

Casino 3, visit 13: Choose Q or C.
