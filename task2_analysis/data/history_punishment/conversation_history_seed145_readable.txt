Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Since Machine T in Casino 2 has delivered 0 points in **10 out of 11 plays (91% success rate)**, I'll continue exploiting it as the near-perfect choice—only switching if forced by visit limits.  

**My choice is: T**  

(*Note: If nearing 24 visits to Casino 2, I'd eventually need to switch to M to comply with the experiment's constraints.*)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine T in Casino 2 delivered -1 points.

PROMPT:
Machine T in Casino 2 delivered -1 points.

Casino 1, visit 15: Choose Z or H.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Since both machines in Casino 1 have performed poorly (Z: 1/11 with 0, H: 0/3), I'll choose Z again as it has at least shown one non-loss outcome, though exploration is nearly exhausted here.  

**My choice is: Z**  

(*Strategic note: With Casino 1 clearly unfavorable, minimizing visits here may be optimal—but per rules, all casinos must be visited 24 times.*)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine Z in Casino 1 delivered -1 points.

=== TRIAL 59 ===
PROMPT:
Machine Z in Casino 1 delivered -1 points.

Casino 1, visit 16: Choose Z or H.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Since both machines in Casino 1 have shown consistently poor performance (Z: 1/12 with 0, H: 0/3), I'll reluctantly choose H to complete the required visits while minimizing further losses.  

**My choice is: H**  

(*Note: This casino is clearly the worst performer—future visits will prioritize finishing its 24 plays quickly to focus on better options elsewhere.*)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine H in Casino 1 delivered -1 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 60 ===
PROMPT:
Machine H in Casino 1 delivered -1 points.

Casino 1, visit 17: Choose Z or H.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

**My choice is: Z**  

(*Strategy update: For the remaining 7 visits to Casino 1, I'll alternate between Z and H to evenly distribute plays while minimizing prolonged losses on one machine.*)

Casino 2, visit 14: Choose M or T.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Despite Machine T's recent -1 result (now 10/12 with 0 points, 83% success rate), it remains vastly superior to M (which has only delivered -1), so I'll continue choosing T to maximize gains.  

**My choice is: T**  

(*Note: Even with occasional losses, T's long-term performance still justifies exploitation—switching to M would be statistically irrational.*)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

--------------------------------------------------

=== TRIAL 62 ===
PROMPT:
Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

Casino 2, visit 15: Choose M or T.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
With Machine T delivering 0 points in **11 out of 13 plays (85% success rate)**—and Machine M consistently losing—I’ll keep exploiting T until visit limits force a switch.  

**My choice is: T**  

(*Rationale: No reason to deviate from a strategy yielding ~85% success, even if M must eventually be tested to meet 24-visit rules.*)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

**My choice is: T**  

(*Efficiency note: T’s performance justifies maxing out its usage before allocating remaining visits to M.*)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine T in Casino 2 delivered 0 points.

Casino 1, visit 24: Choose Z or H.

Please provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.

RESPONSE:
Since this is the **final visit to Casino 1** and both machines have performed poorly (Z: 2/17 with 0, H: 0/8), I'll choose Z for its marginally better track record to conclude this casino’s testing.  

**My choice is: Z**  

(*Experiment complete: All 96 visits fulfilled, with Casinos 2/3/4 showing clear optimal machines [T, Q, G], while Casino 1 remained unfavorable.*)

OUTCOME:
Outcome: Machine Z in Casino 1 delivered 0 points.
