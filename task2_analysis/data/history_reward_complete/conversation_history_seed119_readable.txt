=== SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS ===
You are going to visit four different casinos (named 1, 2, 3, and 4) 24 times each. Each casino owns two slot machines which stochastically give you either 1 point (a win) or 0 points (a loss) with different win probabilities. Your goal is to maximize the total points gained within 96 visits.

After each choice, you will see the outcomes of both the machine you chose AND the machine you didn't choose. Use your memory of past outcomes from both chosen and unchosen machines to make better decisions.

IMPORTANT: For each decision, first provide ONE SENTENCE analyzing your strategy or the casino patterns, then state your choice in the format: 'My choice is: [MACHINE]'.
